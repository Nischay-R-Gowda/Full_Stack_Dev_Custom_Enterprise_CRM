## Key Talking Points

### Technical
- Explain why React hooks (useState/useEffect) are used
- Walk through one API call: component → api.js → Express route → controller → Prisma → SQLite
- Explain Tailwind CSS design system approach
- Explain Recharts for data visualization

### CRM Concepts
- MQL = Marketing Qualified Lead (generated from marketing efforts)
- SQL = Sales Qualified Lead (verified by sales team)
- Deal = Active sales opportunity with expected value
- Pipeline = Visual representation of deals in various stages
- Conversion rate = Converted leads / Total leads

### Design Decisions
- Why Tailwind CSS over CSS modules (consistency, speed, design system)
- Why SQLite (zero-config, perfect for semester project)
- Why no auth (documented limitation, kept scope manageable)
- Why simulated integrations (real APIs require accounts, keys, rate limits)
