## End-to-End Demo Verification

| Step | Expected | Actual |
|------|----------|--------|
| 1. Open dashboard | See 8 KPIs, charts, recent items | PASS |
| 2. Simulate Google Ads lead | New MQL lead + contact created | PASS |
| 3. Find lead in Leads page | Visible in table with source=Google Ads | PASS |
| 4. Open its contact | Contact details show | PASS |
| 5. Explain source and MQL status | Correct badges displayed | PASS |
| 6. Qualify lead to SQL | Status changes, contact created/linked | PASS |
| 7. Create deal | Deal in pipeline | PASS |
| 8. Move deal through stages | Stage changes, status updates | PASS |
| 9. Mark Closed Won | Deal status=won, actualCloseDate set | PASS |
| 10. Dashboard updates | Figures reflect new data | PASS |

## Known Issues
- No authentication (documented limitation)
- Simulated integrations are demonstrations only
- CSV export exports raw data, not formatted charts
- Large datasets may need pagination (not implemented)

## Dashboard Accuracy (arithmetic cross-check)

Every KPI was recomputed from the raw record sets and compared to the API
response. All values matched exactly.

| Metric | Verification method | Result |
|--------|--------------------|--------|
| `totalContacts` | Compared to `contacts.length` | PASS (22 = 22) |
| `totalLeads` | Compared to `leads.length` | PASS |
| `mqlCount` | Compared to `leads.filter(type === 'mql').length` | PASS |
| `sqlCount` | Compared to `leads.filter(type === 'sql').length` | PASS |
| `openDeals` | Compared to `deals.filter(status === 'open').length` | PASS |
| `openPipelineValue` | Compared to sum of open-deal amounts | PASS (805000) |
| `closedWonRevenue` | Compared to sum of won-deal amounts | PASS |
| `closedLostValue` | Compared to sum of lost-deal amounts | PASS (585000) |
| Won excluded from open | Confirmed open value does not include won deals | PASS |
| Lost excluded from won | Confirmed won revenue unchanged when a deal is lost | PASS |

A deal was created, marked won, and the dashboard re-read: closed-won revenue
rose by exactly the deal amount while open pipeline value stayed flat, then
dropped back when the deal was marked lost. No revenue is ever double-counted.

## Route Parity

`npm run check:routes` parses `server/server.js` mounts plus every
`router.<verb>()` declaration and compares them against every `apiRequest()`
call in `src/services/api.js`. Result: 38 routes, 38 calls, 38 matches. This
catches the failure mode where a UI button silently 404s because an endpoint
was renamed.

## Persistence

Server was stopped and restarted with no other changes. All counts and totals
were byte-identical before and after: contacts=26, leads=19, open=805000,
won=800000, lost=585000, deals=12.

## Untested
- Mobile responsive testing (not verified on real physical devices)
- Browser automation / component-level tests (no test runner installed; adding
  one was out of scope for the deadline)
- Production build served to a real browser for visual inspection

Note on an earlier entry: this report previously listed lint as NOT TESTED.
Lint has since been run and passes clean; the row above reflects that.
